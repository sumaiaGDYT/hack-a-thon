        <h1>Living</h1>
        <p>
            Finding a living space for when you go to college/university can be tough. You would have to think about the cost for utility, 
            furniture, rent, etc. Take living with your parents, for example, you won't have to worry about utility, furniture, or rent. It can allow
            you to save up and reduce financial stress for both the student and parents. There won’t be as many distractions outside. You won’t have to stress 
            about what to eat or go for a grocery run. For those who have social anxiety, you will feel less overwhelmed by the transition because the area and climate 
            are familiar and you won’t feel homesick. Living in college dorm/on campus can also be an option, however, there's limited privacy.
            Even if you have your own room, you'll likely share restrooms and common areas. There's also a positive side to living on campus, that is better grades;
            students who live on campus do better academically then those who don't, since they stay in college, they graduate at a higher rate. 
            You can have a worthwhile experience: meeting new people, engage in campus activities more easily. In some cases, the cost for on campus might be 
            cheeper than off campus.

        <h1>Living</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
           You just graduated, congratulations!! You must be thinking of where to live when you attend college. Or what would be the best option because
           finding a living space can be tough whether you want to live on campus, off campus. Living with your parents is also another option if the college
           you attend is close to home. At home, you wouldn't need to worry about rent or utility bill; and there's less distraction at home than in dorms.
           You wouldn't need to worry about what to eat or endless grocery runs, some colleges, however, do not have kitchens in their dorms so you'd have to get 
           your meals from the dining hall. Here I'll talk about the pros and cons of living on campus, off campus, and with your parents. Pro: If you live on campus, you can 
           engage in college activites, meet new people/friends, and focus on your school work. A study showed that students who live on campus have a higher graduation rate 
           than those who live off campus. Going to classes would be easier living on campus. If something were to brake, someone will come to fix it, but you gotta pay them.
           Con: there are distractions and limited privacy, even if you aquire your own room you would still have to share restrooms and other communal places. Like I stated above,
           some colleges do not have kitchen so you'd have to run to dining hall for meals and the food there can sometimes be repetitive and sometimes boring, so you might need to order
           your meals. Now for off campus, the rent might be higher or lower than on campus. </p>
           <p>
           Pro: You'll probably have your space and privacy, no more sharing restrooms (or at least not shared by as many), space and freedom.
           Private apartments are usually quieter and have fewer distractions, and therefore, are better for studying. You can make your own meals. Having a rental history will make it easier 
           to get a place after you graduate, plus you'll have the "real world" experience. Cons: it an be expensive, you've got your months rent, utilites, furniture, groceries, transportation, etc. For
           Internet and cable TV connection or if something were to brake, you're on your own. You'll have chores, renters usually spend more time grocery-shopping, preparing meals, than those who live on campus.
           Lastly, living with your parents, you won't need to worry about distractions or any bills. Pros: save your money, many college grads are choosing to move home to save money. You won't have as much responsibility;
           and you won't get homesick or be overwhelmed by the transition as the area and climate are familiar.

          <h2>Cost</h2>
          <p>
            The cost for housing on campus and off are different. The rental cost for off campus living is slightly cheeper, however, additional cost for furniture, utility, fixtures eventually
            scale up the cost of living outside the campus.

        <h1>Living</h1>
        <p>
            Finding a living space for when you go to college/university can be tough. You would have to think about the cost for utility, 
            furniture, rent, etc. Take living with your parents, for example, you won't have to worry about utility, furniture, or rent. It can allow
            you to save up and reduce financial stress for both the student and parents. There won’t be as many distractions outside. You won’t have to stress 
            about what to eat or go for a grocery run. For those who have social anxiety, you will feel less overwhelmed by the transition because the area and climate 
            are familiar and you won’t feel homesick.
